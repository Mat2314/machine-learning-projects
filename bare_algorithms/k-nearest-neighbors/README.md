# K Nearest Neighbors

## Configuration
First create a virtual enviroment and activate it like:
```
python3 -m venv venv \
. venv/bin/activate
```

Install required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the dataset (example dataset is available here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/iris.csv)

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/iris.csv
```

## Testing

### main.py
In this module it is possible to test the algorithm
by running one of the two functions. Then you can see
results of the algorithm perrofming on given dataset.


### visual_presentations.py
This module simply presents how does the KNN algorithm work.
